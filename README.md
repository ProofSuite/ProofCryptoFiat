### Contracts

The CryptoFiat system is being built with the intent to provide cryptocurrency users with an option to buy tokens that are pegged to traditional currencies such as the US Dollar or the Euro. Solutions such as the cryptocurrency Tether focus on solving this issue by pegging their currency to dollars and storing physical dollars in a vault. This requires Tether holders to trust a centralized organization, which is at odds with the principles of trustless transactions.

The CryptoFiat aims at providing an decentralized alternative to this problem. The contract will be initially capitalized with a large amount of ether. In addition to this initial seed, the CryptoFiat smart-contract will receive commissions from other smart-contracts in the Proof ecosystem.


In the event the amount of ether in the smart-contract is insufficient to maintain the pegging of the Cryptodollar, the CryptoFiat contract is designed to guarantee Cryptodollar token holders the amount of ether they initially sent to the smart-contract.

The Cryptodollar token has an ERC20 interface. The CryptoDollar can be bought via the CryptoFiatHub smart-contract which deals with the buy/sell logic.
To ensure upgradeability of the system, the smart-contract system uses a key/value storage system. The key/value pairs in the storage contract can be updated via the storage proxy libraries which provide helper functions.
Although currently not implemented, an upcoming version of this smart-contract infrastructure will enforce which contracts are controlling and controlled by each other.



### Development and Testing Environment Setup

#### Requirements :
- OSX or Linux (Windows setup is likely possible but not covered in this guide)
- Node (version 8.9.4 recommended)
- Solidity Compiler (version 0.4.18 or other)
- Ganache-cli (v6.0.3)


#### Testing Environment Setup :

- Clone the repository and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/ProofSuite/ProofCryptoFiat.git
cd ProofCryptoFiat
npm install
```

- Install the latest version of truffle (Truffle v4.0.6)


```
npm install -g truffle
```

- Compile contracts
```
truffle compile
```

- Initialize testrpc (or geth)

```
./start_rpc.sh
```

- Migrate contracts to chosen network

```
truffle migrate --network development
```

- Make sure you are using the latest version of node

```
nvm install 8.9.4
nvm use 8.9.4
```


- Fill in `truffle.js` and `deploy_contracts.js` with appropriate wallet addresses. Unlock the corresponding addresses.

- Verify all tests are passing.

You need to re-migrate all contracts before running the test suite

```
truffle migrate --reset && truffle test
```

- You can interact with the contracts via the console

```
truffle console
```


- You can watch for changes on the fileystem with:

```
npm run watch
```

- Lint

```
npm run lint
```

- Run code coverage



```
npm run coverage
```

Some tests will be failing on code coverage as the solidity coverage tool instruments contracts and breaks some of the tests
by adding an additional amount of gas. Currently there does not seem to be any workaround for this.


#### Debugging (with vs-code)

Start the debugger listener
node --inspect-brk $(which truffle) test ./file/name.js


VS-code
Select the "Node Attach" process and add the following snippet to your launch.json file:
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "Attach",
    "port": 9229
}
